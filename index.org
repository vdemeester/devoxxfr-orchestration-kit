   #+END_QUOTE

   Swarm is the /name/ of (almost) 2 projects @Docker:

   - =docker/swarm=, i.e. Swarm v1
   - *swarm mode* and the =docker/swarmkit= project

   /These projects could have been named: pod, gam, herd (group of
   whale 🐳), but it's another story 👼/

** Swarm v1

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Docker Swarm provides native clustering capabilities to turn a
   group of Docker engines into a single, virtual Docker Engine.

   -- docker.com
   #+END_QUOTE

   - Same Docker API, with pros and cons
   - Required an external key/value store (etcd, consul, …)
   - No /service model/ (scaling, updates, discovery,
     load-balancing not built-in)
   - Hard to setup (security, …)

   Feedback aquired help understand limits and build better.

** Swarm mode & =docker/swarmkit= (1/4)

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   A toolkit for orchestrating distributed systems at any scale. It
   includes primitives for node discovery, raft-based consensus, task
   scheduling and more.

   -- github.com/docker/swarmkit
   #+END_QUOTE

   The *swarm mode* is the implementation of =docker/swarmkit= in the
   =docker= engine, starting from *1.12*.

   - Enhance the docker API, integrated with =docker=
   - Not an external key/value store
   - *Secure* by default (automatic TLS keying and signing)
   - Easy to setup
   * =docker/swarmkit= can work without =docker= (with different runtimes)

** Swarm mode & =docker/swarmkit= (2/4)

   - *Declarative service model*, *Scaling*
   - *Desired state reconciliation*: constantly monitors the cluster
     state and reconciles any differences between the actual state
     your expressed desired state
   - *Multi-host networking*
   - *Service discovery*: each service have an entry in the swarm a
     unique DNS name and load balances running containers
   - *Load balancing*: You can expose the ports for services to an
     external load balancer
   - *Rolling updates*: At rollout time you can apply service updates
     to nodes incrementally.
   - …
** Swarm mode & =docker/swarmkit= (3/4)

   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px :style float: right;
   [[file:images/swarm-mode.svg]]

   - *Cluter*: at least one node
   - *Nodes*: a docker engine instance
     - managers: maintain the cluster state

       one of them is elected as the *leader*
     - workers: received and execute task that manager assigned them

** Swarm mode & =docker/swarmkit= (4/4)

   - *Services*: specified by its desired state, will create tasks
     - desired state
     - replicas, global, …
   - *Tasks*:
     - attached to a /worker/
     - created fro a service
     - corresponds to a specific container

  The demo, at home 🏡

** Cluster setup

** Under the hood: docker swarm init

   When we do docker swarm init:

   - a keypair is created for the root CA of our Swarm
   - a keypair is created for the first node
   - a certificate is issued for this node
   - the join tokens are created

** Under the hood: join tokens

   There is one token to join as a worker, and another to join as a manager.

   The join tokens have two parts:
   - a secret key (preventing unauthorized nodes from joining)
   - a fingerprint of the root CA certificate (preventing MITM attacks)

   If a token is compromised, it can be rotated instantly with:

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   docker swarm join-token --rotate <worker|manager>
   #+END_SRC


** Under the hood: docker swarm join

   When a node joins the Swarm:

   - it is issued its own keypair, signed by the root CA
   - if the node is a manager:
     - it joins the Raft consensus
     - it connects to the current leader
     - it accepts connections from worker nodes
   - if the node is a worker:
   - it connects to one of the managers (leader or follower)


** IP address to advertise

    - When running in Swarm mode, each node advertises its address to the others
      (i.e. it tells them "you can contact me on 10.1.2.3:2377")
    - If the node has only one IP address (other than 127.0.0.1), it is used automatically
    - If the node has multiple IP addresses, you must specify which one to use
      (Docker refuses to pick one randomly)
    - You can specify an IP address or an interface name
      (in the latter case, Docker will read the IP address of the interface and use it)
    - You can also specify a port number
      (otherwise, the default port 2377 will be used)

** Join the cluster – gotchas

   - *If your nodes have only one IP address, it's safe to let
     autodetection do the job*

     (Except if your instances have different private and public
     addresses, e.g. on EC2, and you are building a Swarm involving
     nodes inside and outside the private network: then you should
     advertise the public address.)

   - *If your nodes have multiple IP addresses, pick an address which
     is reachable by every other node of the Swarm*

** How many managers do we need?

    - 2N+1 nodes can (and will) tolerate N failures
      (you can have an even number of managers, but there is no point)
    - 1 manager = no failure
    - 3 managers = 1 failure
    - 5 managers = 2 failures (or 1 failure during 1 maintenance)
    - 7 managers and more = now you might be overdoing it a little bit

** Running our first Swarm service

   - Create a service featuring an Alpine container pinging Google resolvers:

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       docker service create alpine ping 8.8.8.8
     #+END_SRC


   - Check where the container was created:

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       docker service ps <serviceID>
     #+END_SRC

   - Check the logs

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       docker-machine ssh nodeX docker logs <containerID>
       # experimental
       docker service logs <serviceID>
     #+END_SRC

** Expose and update a service

   Services can be exposed, with two special properties:
   - the public port is available on every node of the Swarm,
   - requests coming on the public port are load balanced across all instances.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     docker service create --name hello --publish 80 emilevauge/whoami
   #+END_SRC

   Services can be updated using `service update` command (or
   shortcuts like `service scale`)

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     docker service update --replicas=10 hello
     # Same as
     docker service scale hello=10
   #+END_SRC

** Tasks lifecycle

    - If you are fast enough, you will be able to see multiple states:
      - assigned (the task has been assigned to a specific node)
      - preparing (right now, this mostly means "pulling the image")
      - running
    - When a task is terminated (stopped, killed...) it cannot be restarted
      (A replacement task will be created)

** Timeline of an upgrade

   - SwarmKit will upgrade N instances at a time
     (following the update-parallelism parameter)
   - New tasks are created, and their desired state is set to Ready
     (this pulls the image if necessary, ensures resource availability, creates the container ... without starting it)
   - If the new tasks fail to get to Ready state, go back to the previous step
     (SwarmKit will try again and again, until the situation is addressed or desired state is updated)
   - When the new tasks are Ready, it sets the old tasks desired state
     to Shutdown
   - When the old tasks are Shutdown, it starts the new tasks
   - Then it waits for the update-delay, and continues with the next batch of instances


** Overlay network

   - SwarmKit integrates with overlay networks, without requiring an extra key/value store
   - Overlay networks are created the same way as before

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     docker network create --driver overlay demo-net
     docker network ls
     docker-machine ssh worker1 docker network ls
   #+END_SRC

   - Create multiple services and attaches them on services

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     docker service create --network demo-net --name whoami emilevauge/whoami
     docker service create --network demo-net --name curlito nathanleclaire/curl sh -c \
            "while true; do curl http://whoami/; sleep 2; done"
   #+END_SRC

** Securing overlay networks (1/2)

    - By default, overlay networks are using plain VXLAN encapsulation
      (~Ethernet over UDP, using SwarmKit's control plane for ARP resolution)
    - Encryption can be enabled on a per-network basis
      (It will use IPSEC encryption provided by the kernel, leveraging
      hardware acceleration)
    - This is only for the overlay driver
      (Other drivers/plugins will use different mechanisms)



   - Create networks

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       docker network create insecure --driver overlay --attachable
       docker network create secure --opt encrypted --driver overlay --attachable
     #+END_SRC

** Securing overlay networks (2/2)


   - Start a service in one node, and "sniff" network from another

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       docker service create --name whoami --network secure \
              --network insecure --constraint node.hostname==node2 emilevauge/whoami
       docker-machine ssh node2 docker run \
                      --net host jpetazzo/netshoot ngrep -tpd eth0 HTTP
     #+END_SRC

   - From node2, run the following

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       docker run --rm --net insecure nicolaka/netshoot curl whoami
       # should display an HTTP frame
       docker run --rm --net secure nicolaka/netshoot curl web
       # should only display #
     #+END_SRC


** Setup a registry (for this demo) (1/2)

   - We need to run a registry:2 container
     (make sure you specify tag :2 to run the new version!)
   - It will store images and layers to the local filesystem
     (but you can add a config file to use S3, Swift, etc.)
   - Docker requires TLS when communicating with the registry
     - unless for registries on localhost
     - or with the Engine flag --insecure-registry
   - Our strategy: publish the registry container on port 5000,
     so that it's available through localhost:5000 on each node

** Setup a registry (for this demo) (2/2)

   - Create the registry service, publishing its port on the whole
     cluster

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       docker service create --name registry --publish 5000:5000 registry:2
     #+END_SRC

   - Make sure it works on several nodes

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       docker-machine ssh manager1 curl localhost:5000/v2/_catalog
       docker-machine ssh manager1 curl localhost:5000/v2/_catalog
       # […]
     #+END_SRC


   - Make sure we have the busybox image, retag it and push it:

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       docker pull busybox
       docker tag busybox localhost:5000/busybox
       docker push localhost:5000/busybox
     #+END_SRC

** Secret management

   - Docker has a "secret safe" (secure key→value store)
   - You can create as many secrets as you like
   - You can associate secrets to services
   - Secrets are exposed as plain text files, but kept in memory only (using tmpfs)
   - Secrets are immutable (at least in Engine 1.13)
   - Secrets have a max size of 500 KB

** Secrets in practice

   - Can be (ab)used to hold whole configuration files if needed
   - If you intend to rotate secret foo, call it foo.N instead, and map it to foo
     (N can be a serial, a timestamp...)

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       docker service create --secret source=foo.N,target=foo ...
     #+END_SRC

   - You can update (remove+add) a secret in a single command:

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       docker service update ... --secret-rm foo.M --secret-add source=foo.N,target=foo
     #+END_SRC


** Local volumes vs. global volumes

   - Global volumes exist in a single namespace
   - A global volume can be mounted on any node
     (bar some restrictions specific to the volume driver in use; e.g. using an EBS-backed volume on a GCE/EC2 mixed cluster)
   - Attaching a global volume to a container allows to start the container anywhere
     (and retain its data wherever you start it!)
   - Global volumes require extra plugins (Flocker, Portworx...)
   - Docker doesn't come with a default global volume driver at this point
   - Therefore, we will fall back on local volumes (and use constraint
     for our services)

** An app on the swarm

   - Build on our local node (node1)
   - Tag images with a version number
     (timestamp; git hash; semantic...)
   - Upload them to a registry
   - Create services using the images
** Without stacks (1/3)

   - We use =docker-compose= to test develop and run our application
   - Let's build, tag and push our images

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       DOCKER_REGISTRY=localhost:5000
       TAG=v0.1
       for SERVICE in hasher rng webui worker; do
           docker-compose build $SERVICE
           docker tag dockercoins_$SERVICE $DOCKER_REGISTRY/dockercoins_$SERVICE:$TAG
           docker push $DOCKER_REGISTRY/dockercoins_$SERVICE
       done
     #+END_SRC
   - We'll create a network for our application

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       docker network create --driver overlay dockercoins
     #+END_SRC

** Without stacks (2/3)

   - Let's create the services

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       DOCKER_REGISTRY=localhost:5000
       TAG=v0.1
       for SERVICE in hasher rng webui worker; do
           docker service create --network dockercoins --name $SERVICE \
                  $DOCKER_REGISTRY/dockercoins_$SERVICE:$TAG
       done
     #+END_SRC

   - And validate it works by exposing the web ui

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       docker service update webui --publish-add 8000:80
     #+END_SRC

   - We can now scale part of our application, update it, …

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       docker service update --replicas 10 worker
     #+END_SRC

** Without stacks (3/3)

   - To update we will update the image, push it and then call
     =service update=. But first, let's update/define an upgrade
     policy.

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       # Update task 2 by 2, separate by 5s
       docker service update --update-paralellism 2 --update-delay 5s worker
       # update
       docker service update --image $DOCKER_REGISTRY/dockercoins_worker:v0.2
     #+END_SRC

     If something wrong happens, you can rollback

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       docker service update --image $DOCKER_REGISTRY/dockercoins_worker:v0.1
       # Using docker >= 1.13
       docker service update --rollback
     #+END_SRC


** With stacks

   Building and pushing stack services

   - We are going to use the build + image trick that we showed earlier:

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       docker-compose -f my_stack_file.yml build
       docker-compose -f my_stack_file.yml push
       docker stack deploy my_stack --compose-file my_stack_file.yml
     #+END_SRC

   - To update, update your compose file and re-deploy

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       # Do some changes, update the compose file
       docker-compose -f my_stack_file.yml build
       docker-compose -f my_stack_file push
       docker stack deploy my_stack --compose-file my_stack_file.yml
     #+END_SRC
